# Telecom-Data-Analysis

This project focuses on the analysis of telecom data, utilizing PostgreSQL for data storage and Python for processing and analysis. The aim is to streamline the handling of large telecom datasets by automating data cleaning, preprocessing, and providing the foundation for further analysis.

## Project Overview
Telecom companies often deal with massive amounts of data, ranging from customer information to usage statistics and billing data. Cleaning and preprocessing this data is a crucial step before performing any analysis, as raw data typically contains issues like missing values, duplicates, or inconsistent formats. This project addresses these challenges by providing automated methods to prepare telecom data for further use in analytics 
The primary component of this project is the TelecomDataCleaner class, which handles several key preprocessing tasks. The class integrates with a PostgreSQL database to retrieve raw data and apply various cleaning operations.

## Features
**Data Loading:**
* Uses SQLAlchemy to connect to a PostgreSQL database and load telecom data efficiently.
* Supports dynamic query generation to fetch large datasets based on specific parameters (e.g., date range, customer segment).

**Data Cleaning:**

* Missing Values: Handles missing data by either removing or imputing values based on specific criteria (e.g., mean, median, or mode).
* Outlier Detection: Identifies and removes outliers from the dataset based on statistical methods such as Z-scores or IQR (Interquartile Range).
* Date Standardization: Ensures all date fields follow a consistent format, making it easier to work with time-based data.
* Duplicate Removal: Detects and removes duplicate records to ensure the integrity of the dataset.
